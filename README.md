## 📌 Overview
This project presents an end-to-end **smart agriculture monitoring system** that integrates IoT sensors, GPS, cloud database, and machine learning to help farmers make data-driven crop selection decisions.
The system collects soil nutrient data (N, P, K), environmental parameters (pH, moisture, temperature, conductivity), and GPS location — then applies **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC)** to recommend the most suitable crop for each land parcel.

  - Conductivity

### How It Works
 1. **Data Collection** - The dataset comes from the ICFA (Indian Chamber of Food and Agriculture), which is the leading organization for addressing business agendas and policies and serves as a global platform for agribusiness technology and services. 
  2. **Data Preprocessing** - The process of converting data into the desired format, cleaning the data, reducing data dimensions, and more. 
  3. **Selection of Linkage** - The hierarchical clustering method used to determine how to calculate the distance between clusters. The Cophentic Correlation Coefficient (CCC) is used, which measures the correlation between the distances displayed in the dendrogram and the original distances in the data
  4. **Selection of Distance Matrices** - To determine the most appropriate distance matrix, a comparison is made between several methods, such as Manhattan, Euclidean, and cosine similarity.
  5. **Dendrogram** - A graphical representation in the form of a tree diagram used to illustrate/visualize the clustering hierarchy, where points or groups of points that are more similar to one another are combined earlier in the clustering process. 
  6. **Cluster Selection** - The Elbow method and cluster distribution results are used to determine the approximate number of clusters to be used.
  7. **Model Evaluation** - Used to measure performance in providing crop recommendations by calculating accuracy and comparing it with the model’s predictions against real-world data.
  8. **Crop Recommendations** - Once the AHC model has demonstrated good performance, it can be applied to predict crop recommendations based on the provided values.

## System Analytics
  1. **Selection of Linkage** <br>
     Based on the comparison of linkage methods, the *Average* linkage method yielded the highest score, meaning that the dendrogram will be visualized using *Average* linkage.
     
| Linkage | Coefficient Correlation Cophenetic (CCC) |
| :---: | :---: |
| Single | 0,888 |
| Complete | 0,895 |
| Average | 0,945 |
| Ward | 0,880 |

  2. **Cluster Selection** <br>
    Using the *Elbow method* as an evaluation metric to determine the optimal number of clusters. <br>
   <div align = "center"> <img width="371" height="241" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63924f5f-2a4b-4671-9a07-5b0b9e3f6677" /> </div> <br>
    As shown in the figure, the decrease in the *Within-Cluster Sum of Squares* (WCSS) begins to slow significantly in cluster 5. Therefore, cluster 5 is considered effective for clustering in the model.

  4. **Selection of Distance Matrices** <br>
      Selecting a distance matrix to obtain the optimal data distribution. We use the clusters we selected earlier to examine the data distribution results for each distance matrix. From the results, it can be concluded that the *Cosine* matrix exhibits a more balanced data distribution compared to the Manhattan and Euclidean matrices. <br>
     
     | Cluster | Manhattan | Eucledian | Cosine |
     | :---: | :---:|:---:|:---:|
     |1|499|1738|499|
     |2|200|186|499|
     |3|214|219|200|
     |4|316|43|735|
     |5|801|14|267|

  5. **Dendogram** <br>
     The dendrogram in the figure was generated using average linkage and a cosine matrix.

  6. **Pengelompokkan Tanaman Hasil Clustering** <br>
     This clustering is used to identify which plant names are included in each cluster. The clustering results are based on a cosine matrix, 5 clusters, and average linkage. <br>
     
     |Cluter ke-|Nama Tanaman|
     |:---:|:---|
     |1|Corn, Chickpeas, Gude peas, Capri peas, Red beans, Lentils, Mangoes|
     |2|Pomegranate, Orange, Green beans, Coconut, Papaya|
     |3|Grape, Apple|
     |4|Corn, Cotton, Coffee, Melon, Rice, Papaya, Banana, Rami, Watermelon|
     |5|Gude beans, Black beans, Capri beans, Lentils|

## 📑 Result 
  1. **Wi-Fi Connection** <br>
      The device uses a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi connection to connect to the internet. During measurements, the lower the (negative) value—for example, approaching -50 dBm — the better the signal strength. Conversely, if the (negative) value is higher—for example, approaching -100 dBm — the signal strength is weaker.<br>
     <img width="456" height="271" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98a2fbbe-22f9-4bad-8d7b-ee116d10c83b" /> <br>
     Based on the measurement results, it can be concluded that the signal strength of the smartphone hotspot has an effective range of approximately 50 meters and a maximum range of 70 meters. Therefore, the effective distance for data transmission from the device to the *cloud database* is a maximum of 70 meters.
     
  2. **GPS Testing** <br>
     The difference in distance between the device’s readings and the actual point was measured. Here are 5 examples of the results from 10 measurements, <br>

     | Detection Latitude | Detection Longitude | Actual Latitude | Actual Longitude | Different Distance (m) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| -7.365747 | 112.678061 | -7.365686 | 112.678056 | 6.81 |
| -7.378297 | 112.683716 | -7.378299 | 112.683719 | 0.39 |
| -7.399825 | 112.673079 | -7.399798 | 112.67305 | 4.38 |
| -7.391175 | 112.644457 | -7.391162 | 112.644473 | 2.28 |
| -7.348064 | 112.689821 | -7.348062 | 112.689826 | 0.59 |

     Based on 10 measurement results compared with Google Maps, the coordinates generated by the GPS module and the actual coordinates had an average error of 4.18 m, which can still be classified as good accuracy. This is due to variations in GPS detection accuracy, with the degree of variation depending on several factors. 

  3. **Testing the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering Model** <br>
     In the hierarchical clustering model testing, 12, 22, 30, 50, 65, and 100 data points were used to determine whether the error values generated by the data would increase or not as the number of data points increased. <br>

| Total Data | Prediksi Benar | Prediksi Salah | Akurasi (%) | Error (%) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 12 | 11 | 1 | 91.6 | 8.4 |
| 22 | 21 | 1 | 95.6 | 4.6 |
| 30 | 29 | 1 | 96.6 | 3.4 |
| 50 | 49 | 1 | 98 | 2 |
| 65 | 62 | 3 | 95.3 | 4.7 |
| 100 | 95 | 5 | 95 | 5 |
| **Rata-rata** | | | **95** | **4.7** |

    Overall, based on all the data used—ranging from 12 to 100 data points—the average error rate produced by this model was 4.7%, and its average accuracy was 95%. Based on these results, the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering model can be considered to perform quite well.   

  4. **System Integration/ Crop Recommendations** <br>
  
     | N | P | K | Temperature | Humidity | pH | Conductivity | Rekomendasi Tanaman | Waktu Komputasi (s) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 127 | 339 | 334 | 28.3 | 62.6 | 9 | 793 | Anggur | 2.109 |
| 21 | 96 | 89 | 27.4 | 29.1 | 7.7 | 289 | Kacang Arab | 2.118 |
| 5 | 58 | 50 | 27.5 | 20.5 | 9 | 209 | Kacang Gude | 2.112 |
| 35 | 127 | 120 | 28.9 | 27.5 | 8.9 | 354 | Kacang Arab | 2.109 |
| 46 | 154 | 147 | 32.8 | 48 | 9 | 408 | Lentil | 2.113 |
| 6 | 45 | 38 | 28.3 | 12.7 | 6.4 | 184 | Kacang Kapri | 2.111 |
| 208 | 527 | 523 | 30.2 | 53 | 6.8 | 1182 | Anggur | 2.110 |

     The results show that the plant recommendation system performs quite well in recommending plants, with an average computation time of 2.110 seconds. After real-time measurements using the 7-in-1 sensor, measurements were taken using the GPS module. Once the sensor measurement data, plant recommendations, and GPS data were obtained, they were displayed on the LCD. The 7-in-1 sensor measurement data and GPS measurement data were then transmitted to the database via Wi-Fi.
